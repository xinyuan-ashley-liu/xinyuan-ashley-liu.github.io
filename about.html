				<p>I'm a currently studying Health Tech at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu"> Cornell Tech</a>. Prior to this, I did my undergraduate at <a href="https://nyu.edu">New York University</a> majoring in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science and Business.</p>

				<p>I am particularly interested in apply emerging technologies to change the way healthcare is delivered and experienced. I previously did my software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.teladochealth.com/en/">Teladoc Health</a>, a telemedicine company that uses videoconferencing technology to provide on-demand remote medical care. I also worked with Dr. Curtis Cole and Evan Sholle at <a href="https://weill.cornell.edu/">Weill Cornell Medicine</a> to develop a computable phenotype to support diagnosis of problem opioid use. I will join Genomics Resources Core Facility at <a href="https://weill.cornell.edu/">Weill Cornell Medicine</a> to learn more about genomics technologies and do data analysis, interpretation, and validation. </p>
